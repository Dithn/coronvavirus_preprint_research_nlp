SARS-CoV-2 has great person-to-person transmission capability among close contacts. The secondary cases are more prone to have mild symptoms than index cases. There is no increased RR of secondary infection in blood relatives versus unrelated contacts. The high rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections highlights the urgent need to enhance active case finding strategy for early detection of infectious patients.,2020-03-18,8.0,349.0,43.625,1.0,"Clusters of Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in a Non-Epidemic Area, China",59.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551388
"1) The hospital reporting speed--the first case report to the local CDC, for H7N9(2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan city was 6 and 19 days, respectively. 2). The pathogen inspection speed-- the period from case reporting to technically confirming and re-checking pathogens, for COVID-19 was much quicker than that in H7N9(2013) in Shanghai (12days vs. 31days). 3). The government responding speed --from re-checking pathogens to the local government’s emergency response, for H7N9 (2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan was 4 and 15 days, respectively. 4) The total emergency disposal time of local government was 5 days longer in COVID-19 in Wuhan city than H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai (46 days vs. 41 days).InterpretationFrom H7N9 to COVID-19, the speed of detecting unknown pathogens greatly improved in China, whereas the hospital reporting of epidemics and decision-making by government of Hubei province was significantly slow, which might be an important influential factor of the outbreak of COVID-19. Improving the emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of the emerging infectious disease and public health crisis in the future.",2020-03-18,8.0,328.0,41.0,30.0,The Response of the Government's Emergency System to the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: A Retrospective Comparative Study,83.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551347

"As the outbreak was rapid and sudden, and great uncertainties in COVID-19 still remain, we faced substantial challenges and difficulties. As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission.

Patients with negative RT-PCR results with symptoms and apparent SARS-CoV-2 infection on chest radiographs had higher levels of C-reactive protein and were more likely to have comorbidities than those with positive results. Low detection efficiency of viral nucleic acid might be related to the similarities in features of the two groups. Clinicians should be aware that the condition of negative patients with high levels of CRP might deteriorate and further investigations regarding the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection are needed.,2020-03-17,9.0,316.0,35.111111111111100,15.0,Confusion and Thinking on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Negative RT-PCR Results for SARS-CoV-2,53.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551322
