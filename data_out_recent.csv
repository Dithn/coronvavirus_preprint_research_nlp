"As the largest stool samples and the longest monitoring time so far, our study demonstrated that in spite of the virus harbour in the respiratory tract earlier than intestinal tract as 106 patients (77%) showed the first throat swab virus positive and only 22 patients (16%) showed the first stool virus positive in the first 10 days after their disease onset respectively, however, SARS-CoV-2 would harbour in the both respiratory tract and intestinal tract for 10-14 days. In addition, many patients appeared stool RNA positive when their swab RNA had turn negative and we suggested that both throat swabs and stool specimens are needed to absolutely confirm the elimination of the SARS-CoV-2.",2020-03-23,90.0,14.0,"Clinical Features of Stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA Positive in 137 COVID-19 Patients in Taizhou, China",15.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551383
