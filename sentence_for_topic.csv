Timely on-site evaluation of positive test results informed on local transmission cycles, which in turn led to successful extension of test indications beyond national guidelines. In addition, the infrastructure was exploited for testing and contact tracing of hospital personnel as cases strongly increased in Germany. "
1,25.0,0.0543,"pandemic, community, health, term, policy, system, strategy, economic, ongoing, area"," Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that if routine health care is disrupted – as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic – the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come. "

During hospitalization, by monitoring the changes in the burning point indicators in the early warning system, clinicians can combine their respective weights to determine whether the patient has crossed the burning point. If so, CEPE will occur within five days. Hopefully, by using this early warning system, clinicians could intervene proactively before a CEPE develops, thereby avoiding irreversible disease progression and minimizing the likelihood of fatality."

Dynamic prevalence changes implied that a gradually and significant decreasing trend of infection have been formed along with line of strict intervention and screening, but due to uncertainty and variability of pathogen as well as the wide spectrum hosts and various environmental exposure, more risk-based screening and surveillance is further needed. Given institutively recognition on the lower concentrated distribution of current prevalence of COVID-19 and the existence of asymptomatic infections, current predictive value of PPV is not so sensitive to help in making a right decision for confirmed infection in low risk prevailed region. In such circumstance, two solutions are suggested, first is to seek the second or more confirmatory RT-PCR assays that target a different part of genome to increase statistical assurance for positive confirmation. Secondly, if contradictory results of tests are still yielded, the confirmed case should be based more on patient epidemiology history and clinical assessment, rather than just RT-PCR test. "

In-hospital mortality was demonstrated in 4 (21%) and 12 (2.8%) patients in positive and negative COVID-19 groups, respectively. Among expired patients in positive COVID-19 cases, one underwent valve surgery and the other 3 patients underwent CABG. Leukocytosis and lymphopenia were both present in the two survived and expired positive COVID-19 groups. However, the median of white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher in patients who expired while the percentage of lymphocyte was lower in these individuals."
19,4.0,0.0562,"system, national, information, process, point, great, occur, efficiency, cepe, diarrhea"," Prevention of transmissions to the elderly is of great importance, considering their high case fatality rate. National triage systems are required to allocate resources to patients at great risk, and to reduce any preventable deaths.

The IL-6 level was approximately ten-fold of the normal range in 23.7% of the patients and more than 50% of them signify IL-6 over three-fold of normal range. The levels of BS, LDL, VLDL, ALP, TSH, CRP, platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes were significantly different between patients with diverse levels of IL-6. The values of triglyceride, LDL, VLDL, red blood cells and platelets showed an indirect linear trend and the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and CRP demonstrated a direct linear trend with elevating rate of IL-6. Furthermore, IL-6 levels had a significant and direct correlation with troponin I, CRP, ferritin and pro-calcitonin while it had a significant and indirect correlation with VLDL.

Whilst some of the disturbances reported may be common to other infectious diseases and non-specific, smell and taste abnormalities shift the attention on the nervous system as entry door and damage location even for SARS-CoV-2 virus. This interpretation should prime research trials on early therapeutic approaches halting the infection in the nervous system.   "
30,25.0,0.143,"pandemic, community, health, term, policy, system, strategy, economic, ongoing, area"," The effects of sustained community transmission would go beyond the cases and deaths seen and the resources needed to respond to these but would also cripple many of the health systems due to health workers falling ill / being quarantined plus have wider social, economic and political effects. It is crucial for countries to avoid a scenario of sustained community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 therefore. The effect of breaking community transmission, in terms of lives saved, admissions avoided, and the social economic benefits are significant, and most likely outweigh any costs of preventing this scenario. The effectiveness of distancing measures, and better hygiene practices need to be advocated for in all Countries as the most effective approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. "

Fever predicted the presence of COVID-19 (likelihood ratio of 1.19) and cough did not (likelihood ratio of 0.57). The presence of cough increased the odds of influenza by 1.83 times. When signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infections are used, a naïve Bayes model accurately predicted COVID-19, influenza, and other upper respiratory infections (micro average AROC of 0.79)."
33,25.0,0.1101,"pandemic, community, health, term, policy, system, strategy, economic, ongoing, area"," Covid-19 pandemic represents a worldwide emergency in term of psychological, social and economic consequences. Our data suggests that in the Italian population actual differences in individual perception of the Covid-19 outbreak severity for health are dramatically modulated by psychosocial frailty (i.e., distress and loneliness). At the same time, problem-oriented coping strategies and enhanced empathic abilities increase people awareness about the severity of the impact of Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need of consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis."

Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government “declared war against disease” with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. We have found out that Twitter reflected the structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify clear communities of governing party, mainstream oppostition and a protestant group and potential sources of disinformation. We have also detected bluring boundaries between comminities after disease introduction. "

Of the 370 COVID-19 survivors, no survivors were readmitted due to recurrence of SARS-CoV-2-positive pneumonia. Sixty (16.2%) survivors had post-discharge cough and 45 (12.2%) had breathlessness after activity. One hundred and seventy-three (46.8%) survivors worried about recurrence and 174 (47.0%) worried about infection to others such as their family. Two hundred and ninety-three (79.2%) survivors took a home quarantine lifestyle. Fifty (13.5%) survivors occurred anxiety and 40 (10.8%) survivors occurred depression. Survivors were most bothered by sleeping disorders (29.5%). Four survivors (1.1%) once had thoughts of suicide in several days. Three hundred and fifty-six (96.2%) survivors were willing to return to hospital for health examination. Anxiety was significantly associated with post-discharge respiratory symptoms, worry about recurrence and worry about infection to others (P&lt;0.05).

Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66·1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89·3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir or the combination of two antiviral drugs was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA after adjusting for confounders. "

Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent.

The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patient whose level of IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to the progression of pneumonia. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a biomarker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients.  "
