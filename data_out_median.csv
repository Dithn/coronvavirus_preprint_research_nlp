"A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% of female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), coughing (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement or interstitial pneumonia evidenced by CT imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline IL-6 was significantly increased in severe type which is closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patient whose level of IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to the progression of pneumonia. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a biomarker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients.",2020-03-10,399.0,17.0,15,26.6,The Potential Role of IL-6 in Monitoring Coronavirus Disease 2019,103.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3548761&utm_source=EC&utm_medium=Connect
