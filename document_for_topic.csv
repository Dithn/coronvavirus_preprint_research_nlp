0.0,0.2778,"model, predict, indicator, predictive, regression, accurately, sensitivity, cohort, score, base"," A predictive HNC-LL (Hypertension–Neutrophil count–C-reactive protein– Lymphocyte count–  Lactate dehydrogenase) score was established based on multivariate logistic regression analysis results. The HNC-LL score accurately predicted disease severity in the Honghu training cohort (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.861, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.800–0.922;  P  &lt;0.001); the Honghu internal validation cohort (AUC = 0.871, 95% CI: 0.769–0.972;  P  &lt;0.001); and the Nanchang external validation cohort (AUC = 0.826, 95% CI: 0.746–0.907;  P  &lt;0.001), and outperformed other models including the CURB-65 score model, MuLBSTA score model, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio model. Moreover, the clinical significance of HNC-LL in accurately predicting patients with severe COVID-19 in the early phase was confirmed.  "
1.0,0.3655,"level, crp, elevate, dimer, correlation, range, significant, lactate_dehydrogenase, normal, ferritin"," IL-6 levels were significantly high in hospitalized patients compared with healthy individuals (P &lt; 0.001). The IL-6 level was approximately ten-fold of the normal range in 23.7% of the patients and more than 50% of them signify IL-6 over three-fold of normal range. The levels of BS, LDL, VLDL, ALP, TSH, CRP, platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes were significantly different between patients with diverse levels of IL-6. The values of triglyceride, LDL, VLDL, red blood cells and platelets showed an indirect linear trend and the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and CRP demonstrated a direct linear trend with elevating rate of IL-6. Furthermore, IL-6 levels had a significant and direct correlation with troponin I, CRP, ferritin and pro-calcitonin while it had a significant and indirect correlation with VLDL. A hazardous level of IL-6 probably threatening the critical health factors and has a crucial role in immune-mediated acute lung injury in CIOVID-19 patients."
2.0,0.1325,"covid, role, play, study, situation, linear, case, utilize, youtube, distribution"," Over one-quarter of most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 contained misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide. As the current COVID-19 pandemic worsens, public health agencies must better utilize YouTube to deliver timely and accurate information and to minimize the spread of misinformation. This may play a significant role in successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic.  "
3.0,0.2848,"positive, negative, swab, show, throat, median, sample, stool, specimen, tract","  As the largest stool samples and the longest monitoring time so far, our study demonstrated that in spite of the virus harbour in the respiratory tract earlier than intestinal tract as 106 patients (77%) showed the first throat swab virus positive and only 22 patients (16%) showed the first stool virus positive in the first 10 days after their disease onset respectively, however, SARS-CoV-2 would harbour in the both respiratory tract and intestinal tract for 10-14 days. In addition, many patients appeared stool RNA positive when their swab RNA had turn negative and we suggested that both throat swabs and stool specimens are needed to absolutely confirm the elimination of the SARS-CoV-2.  "
4.0,0.1203,"system, national, information, process, point, great, occur, efficiency, cepe, diarrhea"," The baseline nomogram model can be employed at admission to identify the high-risk patients who might develop CEPE. During hospitalization, by monitoring the changes in the burning point indicators in the early warning system, clinicians can combine their respective weights to determine whether the patient has crossed the burning point. If so, CEPE will occur within five days. Hopefully, by using this early warning system, clinicians could intervene proactively before a CEPE develops, thereby avoiding irreversible disease progression and minimizing the likelihood of fatality."
5.0,0.238,"treatment, viral, antiviral, rna, corticosteroid, drug, body, therapy, clearance, antibiotic"," We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97·2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66·1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89·3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir or the combination of two antiviral drugs was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA after adjusting for confounders. "
6.0,0.1078,"disease, onset, chronic, ocular, control, syndrome, fatal, treat, clustering, common"," The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection was of clustering onset, and can cause severe respiratory disease and even death, especially for elderly patients with chronic disease. The mortality of ICU patients confirmed with COVID-19 was considerably high. The lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes might be the main target of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related to the severity and mortality of disease, and the cytokine storm may be associated with the worsening of the disease. While the source of the virus, epidemiology, pathophysiology, transmission route, the full clinical spectrum of disease and effective treatment still need to be further studied."
7.0,0.2533,"follow, present, patient, baseline, progress, severity, lesion, diarrhea, differentiate, plasma"," GGO (48, 85.7%), vascular enlargement (44, 78.6%) were the most frequent signs in patients with COVID-19. 64.3% of the margins of the lesions were uneasily differentiated. No significant correlations were found in terms of leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and C-reactive protein. In contrast, the uneasily differentiated margin was negative correlated with the Ct value (r=-0.283, P=0.042). In another word, an uneasily differentiated margin indicated a lower Ct value (P=0.043). Patients with a lower Ct value were likely to present a progress follow-up change (P=0.022). The Ct value at baseline could predict a progress follow-up changes with an AUC of 0.685 (Cut-off value=29.48). All the 4 with normal CT findings presented new lesion(s) on follow-up CT scans.  "

Because of reverse scoring for self-efficacy, lower self-efficacy was associated with high levels of loneliness. Stratified analyses stratified by social demography characteristics showed that the no associations between self-efficacy score and loneliness score remained significant in over 35 years old or doctors."
9.0,0.1066,"include, support, analysis, organ, ventilation, ard, individual, biomarker, ventilatory, strategy"," Mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was high. Lymphopenia, ARDS and septic shock were notable in the clinical course of critical illness. Ventilation support and hemodynamic support were usually needed. Multi-organ failure induced by ARDS was the main death cause.    "

11.0,0.1248,"disease, find, monitor, multiple, important, approach, potential, additionally, isolation, specific"," Our findings provide the evidence that the CT imaging score can be used to reflect disease severity, and the multiple enzyme release, inflammation storm, and hypercoagulability are prominent indicators to monitor the changes of disease progression and prognosis of COVID-19, which are critical to explain the multiple organ injuries or death in clinic and also guide therapeutic strategy."
12.0,0.1488,"care, medical, resource, worker, prompt, home, provider, personnel, facility, expose"," Our findings confirmed 2019-nCoV could easily spread through direct personal contact in a hospital setting and provided compelling evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for possible transmission of this novel coronavirus. Medical workers engaging in daily interaction with their fellow workers should be personally under effective protection against the infection. The health-care workers developing any possible associated symptoms should seek prompt medical attention and be duly isolated, thereby minimizing secondary transmission of 2019-nCoV in health-care associated outbreaks. Adequate protection against exposure to infected patients can effectively protect health-care workers from 2019-nCoV infection. "
13.0,0.2427,"outbreak, emergency, improve, response, effective, infectious, capacity, manage, detect, highly"," Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect and control outbreaks, which is underpinned by global variances in the strength of health systems to manage health emergencies. Half of all countries analysed in this study currently have in place operational readiness capacities which should enable an effective response to any potential health emergencies including 2019-nCoV. However, it is crucial to integrate/triangulate findings from local risk assessments to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to 2019-nCoV. Some countries may require external support if cases are identified and the infection spreads rapidly within their borders. As part of the commitment to the IHR (2005) countries should be implementing capacity building action to strengthen their ability to effectively prevent and manage health emergencies and the application of data analysis can support focused targeting of critical gaps that currently exist. Commitment to IHR (2005) also involves collaboration between States Parties to improve capacities for preventing and managing health emergencies which should also be carried out to improve preparedness. This will strengthen global readiness to contain existing outbreaks including the ongoing international spread of 2019-nCoV. "
14.0,0.3124,"feature, lung, ggo, image, opacity, consolidation, peripheral, pulmonary, pattern, ground_glass","  Finally, 40 eligible studies with 4183 patients with COVID-19 were used for meta-analysis. The rate of positive CT scan in patients with COVID-19 was 94.5% (95%CI: 91.7-96.3). Bilateral lung involvement, pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed (GGO pulse consolidation or reticular), consolidation, reticular, and presence of nodule findings in CT scan of COVID-19 pneumonia patients were respectively estimated to be 94.5% (95%CI: 91.7-96.3), 64.9% (95%CI: 54.1-74.4), 49.2% (95%CI: 35.7-62.8), 30.3% (95%CI: 19.6-43.6), 17.0% (95%CI: 3.9-50.9) and 16.6% (95%CI: 13.6-20.2). The distribution of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was peripheral (70.0% [95%CI: 57.8-79.9]), central (3.9% [95%CI: 1.4-10.6]), and peripheral and central (31.1% [95%CI: 19.5-45.8]). The most common pulmonary lobes involved were right lower lobe (86.5% [95%CI: 57.7-96.8]) and left lower lobe (81.0% [95%CI: 50.5-94.7]).  "

We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. "
16.0,0.1744,"increase, covid, severity, related, decrease, enhance, human, datum, guideline, fatality", Viral load was not related to the severity of COVID-19 in early stage of COVID-19. Male and delayed diagnosis increased a risk of enhancing COVID-19 severity while decreased the risk with increasing generation of infection. SARS-CoV-2 may increase human-to-human transmissibility through long term replication within individual human host.
17.0,0.0465,"mortality, reduce, early, series, woman, single, vulnerable, decrease, modify, pneumonia"," The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas. "
18.0,0.1319,"child, clinical, history, characteristic, exposure, epidemiological, adult, long, fecal, describe"," Children accounted for 1•16 % of mild cases. Some children had uncertain contact history and no clinical symptoms. The etiological diagnosis of children was more important than clinical diagnosis. Disappearance of clinical manifestations of children and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test with positive result were not parallel. SARS-CoV-2 had long detoxification time, and SARS-CoV-2 cases with positive results appeared again. The production regularity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in children and their effect on the body remain unknown."
19.0,0.1842,"critical, illness, mild, decrease, iqr, trend, condition, improve, cell, restrictive"," The median age of the 101 patients was 51.0 years (IQR, 37.0-61.0) and 34 patients [33.6%] were medical staffs. On admission, the number of patients with uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia were 1 [1%], 86 [85%], 11[11%] and 2[2%], and another could not be unclassified because of pregnancy. 44 cases [51%] of the 86 mild pneumonia progressed to severe condition with 4 ( IQR, 1-7) days in median, and 9 patients [10%] further worsened to critical pneumonia within 4 (IQR, 3-8) days; 2 of the 11 severe patients improved to mild condition while 3 others deteriorated. Significant differences were observed among groups of different clinical stages in numbers of influenced pulmonary segments (6 (IQR, 2-12) vs 12 (IQR,6-15) vs 17 (IQR, 10-18), P &lt;0.001). A significantly upward trend was witnessed in ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows (33% vs 42% vs 55% vs 80%, P &lt;0.001) while pure ground-glass opacities gradually decreased with regard to radiologic patterns. While lymphocytes, prealbumin and albumin showed a downward trend as disease progressed from mild to severe or critical condition, an increasing trend was found in white blood cells, C-reactive protein, neutrophils and lactate dehydrogenase. And the proportions of serum amyloid A &gt; 300 mg/L in mild, severe and critical conditions were 18%, 46% and 71%, respectively. "
20.0,0.219,"covid, hospital, report, pathogen, greatly, cluster, speed, shanghai, day, pediatric"," 1) The hospital reporting speed--the first case report to the local CDC, for H7N9(2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan city was 6 and 19 days, respectively. 2). The pathogen inspection speed-- the period from case reporting to technically confirming and re-checking pathogens, for COVID-19 was much quicker than that in H7N9(2013) in Shanghai (12days vs. 31days). 3). The government responding speed --from re-checking pathogens to the local government’s emergency response, for H7N9 (2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan was 4 and 15 days, respectively. 4) The total emergency disposal time of local government was 5 days longer in COVID-19 in Wuhan city than H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai (46 days vs. 41 days).InterpretationFrom H7N9 to COVID-19, the speed of detecting unknown pathogens greatly improved in China, whereas the hospital reporting of epidemics and decision-making by government of Hubei province was significantly slow, which might be an important influential factor of the outbreak of COVID-19. Improving the emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of the emerging infectious disease and public health crisis in the future."
21.0,0.1181,"diagnosis, important, highly, clinical, limit, routine, testing, guide, novel_coronavirus, criterion"," We employed four types of AI technology to screen all patients, achieve 18 indexes associated with significant COVID-19 diagnosis and the most important attribute is WBC, Eosinophil count, Eosinophil rate, 2019 novel coronavirus RNA (2019n-CoV) and Amyloid-A in laboratory, also matched with 2019 China virus diagnosis clinical guide. "
22.0,0.1846,"sars_cov, infection, mild, potential, progression, explain, young, conjunctival, immunity, epithelium", The conjunctival epithelium and the conducting airways appear to be potential portals of infection of SARS-CoV-2. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated comparably in the alveolar epithelium explaining the progression of infection to a primary viral pneumonia.
23.0,0.189,"early, progression, facilitate, identification, week, helpful, ldh, invasive_ventilation, rapid, age"," Younger age, higher levels of LDH, blood glucose, and MLR on hospital admission are associated with shorter duration from admission to invasive ventilation. These potential predictors facilitate the identification of rapid disease progression and earlier requirement for invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19."

The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest CT was 95.6%, the proportion of severe cases in all infected cases was 24.3%, and the mortality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 6.4%.    "
25.0,0.143,"pandemic, community, health, term, policy, system, strategy, economic, ongoing, area"," The effects of sustained community transmission would go beyond the cases and deaths seen and the resources needed to respond to these but would also cripple many of the health systems due to health workers falling ill / being quarantined plus have wider social, economic and political effects. It is crucial for countries to avoid a scenario of sustained community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 therefore. The effect of breaking community transmission, in terms of lives saved, admissions avoided, and the social economic benefits are significant, and most likely outweigh any costs of preventing this scenario. The effectiveness of distancing measures, and better hygiene practices need to be advocated for in all Countries as the most effective approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. "
26.0,0.5376,"cell, cd, immune, ace, expression, level, kirp, ucec, neutrophil, study"," ACE2 was elevated in both UCEC and KIRP, which suggests that tumor tissues are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in UCEC and KIRP. High ACE2 had a favorable prognosis in UCEC and KIRP (OS HR0.47, 95%CI=0.30 to 0.73, OS HR0.44, 95%CI=0.24 to 0.81, respectively). In addition, the expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage (r=0.322, p&lt;0.001) in KIRP. Similarly, ACE2 has a positive correlation with B cell (r=0.166, p&lt;0.01), CD4+T cell (r=0.154, p&lt;0.01), neutrophil (r=0.223, p&lt;0.001) and dendritic cell (r=0.271, p&lt;0.001) immune infiltration levels in UCEC. After correction of tumor purity, ACE2 in UCEC was significantly positively correlated with FCRL2 and MS4A1 in B cells, and FCGR3B, CEACAM3, SIGLEC5, CSF3R and S100A12 in neutrophils and CD84 in macrophages, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with CD68 and CD84 in macrophages. High ACE2 expression level has a favorable prognosis in the enriched B cells, CD4 + memory T cells, CD8 + T cells and macrophases subgroup in UCEC,and the enriched regulatory T cells and type 1 T helper cells subgroup in KIRP. Promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced, which explains to some extent the elevated ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP. Finally ,GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases were used to study the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro, the results showed that ACE2 expression levels in both of them were reduced after SARS-CoV infection."
27.0,0.0917,"death, hospitalization, elderly, main, icu, require, predictor, person, system, develop","  COVID-19 pneumonia requiring admission to the ICU had a considerably high mortality rate. Many predictors are associated with mortality, but decreased oxygenation index is the main risk factor for death in these patients. Critically ill patients with a relatively high oxygenation index should be transferred to the ICU early to reach a favorable outcome."
28.0,0.1919,"infection, ncov, rate, fever, combination, account, valuable, line, muscle, dyspnea","    The infection rate of 2019-nCoV in the outpatients from the fever clinics was high and the majority of COVID-19 were mild cases. The highest nucleic acid detection rate for 2019-nCoV infection was observed in patients with muscle ache, followed by dyspnea. The combination of fever, lower accounts of eosinophils and the imaging features of ground-glass opacity in bilateral lungs might be a valuable indicator for 2019-nCoV infection."
29.0,0.3262,"healthcare, lead, provide, household, closure, school, parameter, obligation, reduction, mutation"," The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%.         "

31.0,0.147,"severe, patient, significantly, year, male, age, positively, mild, detect, gold"," Severe COVID-19 patients were significantly older than the no severe patients. Immune systems of severe COVID-19 patients were significantly suppressed, and advanced age(&gt;50 years), low levels of CD4 (≤461) or CD8 (≤241) was important clinical manifestations of rapid deterioration. CK values in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than in no severe patients. CD4 and CD8 were incorporated into the MuLBSTA to establish a new model, which is an ideal risk prediction model for COVID-19 patients. "

Fever (85.8%), cough (36.0%), fatigue (23.6%) and chest tightness (11.9%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. As of February 28, 2020, of the 1,663 patients included in this study, 26.0% were discharged, 169 died (10.2%), and 63.8% remain hospitalized. More than 1/3 of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Most (99.8%) patients had abnormal results Chest CT, and the most common manifestations of chest CT were local patchy shadowing (70.7%) and ground-glass opacity (44.8%). On admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 51.1% of the patients, mononucleosis in 26.6%, and erythrocytopenia in 61.3%. Most of the patients had increased levels of C-reactive protein. Compared to non-severe patients, severe patients might have more obvious abnormal laboratory results related to inflammation, coagulation disorders, liver and kidney damage (all P&lt;0.05).  "

For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China."

The reason that the positive saliva detection rate was as high as 75% (3/4) in critically-ill patients in our study might be due to virus invasion caused by high viral loads or destroyed salivary glands at the late stage of the disease. The emergence of viral particles in the saliva might be an indication that the disease condition of the patient has deteriorated and progressed to the terminal stage. Hence, saliva may be a new source of diagnostic specimens for critically-ill patients, since it can be easily collected without any invasive procedures."
38.0,0.1074,"health, public, mental, work, state, prioritize, lockdown, significance, carry, learning"," Even though this research is limited by its cross-sectional design, it is possible to infer that mental health varies by demographic attributes, obligations and health behaviours. Those who report higher distress must work outside during quarantine, live with an elderly person and carry a risk factor for COVID-19, among other factors. Identifying those who are most vulnerable would help to prioritize those who may need the greatest psychological aid and assist public health practitioners in developing support strategies."

Given institutively recognition on the lower concentrated distribution of current prevalence of COVID-19 and the existence of asymptomatic infections, current predictive value of PPV is not so sensitive to help in making a right decision for confirmed infection in low risk prevailed region. In such circumstance, two solutions are suggested, first is to seek the second or more confirmatory RT-PCR assays that target a different part of genome to increase statistical assurance for positive confirmation.
