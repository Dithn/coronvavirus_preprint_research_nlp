"The mortality of diabetic patients with COVID-19 was 35Â·4%, and diabetic patients were prone to suffer multi-organ dysfunction, secondary infection and worse outcome. Diabetes the disease itself, together with old age, other underlying comorbidities and poor glycemic control during hospitalization contributed to the poor outcomes of diabetic patients with COVID-19.",2020-03-20,3498.0,31.0,5,699.6,"Diabetic Patients with COVID-19, Characteristics and Outcome: A Two-Centre, Retrospective, Case Control Study",449.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551369

"Our study suggests that respiratory samples are still the most effective for detecting SARS-CoV-2, while it is necessary to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, especially in the later stage of the disease.

"1) The hospital reporting speed--the first case report to the local CDC, for H7N9(2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan city was 6 and 19 days, respectively. 2). The pathogen inspection speed-- the period from case reporting to technically confirming and re-checking pathogens, for COVID-19 was much quicker than that in H7N9(2013) in Shanghai (12days vs. 31days). 3). The government responding speed --from re-checking pathogens to the local governmentâs emergency response, for H7N9 (2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan was 4 and 15 days, respectively. 4) The total emergency disposal time of local government was 5 days longer in COVID-19 in Wuhan city than H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai (46 days vs. 41 days).InterpretationFrom H7N9 to COVID-19, the speed of detecting unknown pathogens greatly improved in China, whereas the hospital reporting of epidemics and decision-making by government of Hubei province was significantly slow, which might be an important influential factor of the outbreak of COVID-19. Improving the emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of the emerging infectious disease and public health crisis in the future.",2020-03-18,301.0,30.0,7,43,The Response of the Government's Emergency System to the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: A Retrospective Comparative Study,81.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551347
"Compared with CT images of GGO in patients with early-stage lung cancer, GGO features in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have their own characteristics and t he evolution of GGO images corresponds with the progression of disease in a short time. The evaluation of GGO features combined with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory findings would facilitate the early detection and identification of COVID-19 pneumonia.  For the asymptomatic patients with GGO manifestation on CT findings, it is particularly essential to recheck chest CT within one week. Fully understanding the imaging features and differential diagnosis of COVID-19 will facilitate early detection and isolation of patients with SARS-CoV-2.",2020-03-23,86.0,27.0,2,43,"Comparison of Chest CT Images Featured with Ground Grass Opacity between COVID-19 Pneumonia and Early-Stage Lung Cancer in Wuhan,China: A Single-Centered, Retrospective, Observational Study",18.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551427
Patients with negative RT-PCR results with symptoms and apparent SARS-CoV-2 infection on chest radiographs had higher levels of C-reactive protein and were more likely to have comorbidities than those with positive results. Low detection efficiency of viral nucleic acid might be related to the similarities in features of the two groups. Clinicians should be aware that the condition of negative patients with high levels of CRP might deteriorate and further investigations regarding the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection are needed.,2020-03-17,304.0,15.0,8,38,Confusion and Thinking on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Negative RT-PCR Results for SARS-CoV-2,52.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551322

"As the outbreak was rapid and sudden, and great uncertainties in COVID-19 still remain, we faced substantial challenges and difficulties. As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission.
