" Within 24 hours, our setup led to pronounced reduction of patient load in the ER and enabled risk assessment of 1166 patients of which 746 (64%) received testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the first 2 weeks of operation (February 27th – March 12th, 2020). Timely on-site evaluation of positive test results informed on local transmission cycles, which in turn led to successful extension of test indications beyond national guidelines. In addition, the infrastructure was exploited for testing and contact tracing of hospital personnel as cases strongly increased in Germany.

" Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that if routine health care is disrupted – as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic – the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

" GI manifestations should be considered as common presenting symptoms of COVID-19, initiating quicker confirmatory testing to avoid misdiagnosis and transmission of the disease.

" Identification of these factors associated with severe COVID-19 will help the physicians working at all levels of healthcare (primary, secondary, tertiary and ICU) in determining which patients need home care, hospital care, HDU care, and ICU admission; and thus, prioritize the scarce healthcare resource use more judiciously.

" COVID-19 was associated with an approximately 52% lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes, compared to SARS after adjusting for clinical parameters. Nonetheless, as there is still an ongoing, fast growing number of COVID-19 patients worldwide, the absolute number of deaths is going to be enormous.

" Large sample size designed-experiment of Bayesian inference provided an accurate and intuitive understanding on current status of COVID-19 in China. Dynamic prevalence changes implied that a gradually and significant decreasing trend of infection have been formed along with line of strict intervention and screening, but due to uncertainty and variability of pathogen as well as the wide spectrum hosts and various environmental exposure, more risk-based screening and surveillance is further needed. Given institutively recognition on the lower concentrated distribution of current prevalence of COVID-19 and the existence of asymptomatic infections, current predictive value of PPV is not so sensitive to help in making a right decision for confirmed infection in low risk prevailed region. In such circumstance, two solutions are suggested, first is to seek the second or more confirmatory RT-PCR assays that target a different part of genome to increase statistical assurance for positive confirmation. Secondly, if contradictory results of tests are still yielded, the confirmed case should be based more on patient epidemiology history and clinical assessment, rather than just RT-PCR test.

From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. We have found out that Twitter reflected the structural division of the Polish political sphere.

" The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients.

" ACE2 was elevated in both UCEC and KIRP, which suggests that tumor tissues are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in UCEC and KIRP. High ACE2 had a favorable prognosis in UCEC and KIRP (OS HR0.47, 95%CI=0.30 to 0.73, OS HR0.44, 95%CI=0.24 to 0.81, respectively). In addition, the expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage (r=0.322, p&lt;0.001) in KIRP. Similarly, ACE2 has a positive correlation with B cell (r=0.166, p&lt;0.01), CD4+T cell (r=0.154, p&lt;0.01), neutrophil (r=0.223, p&lt;0.001) and dendritic cell (r=0.271, p&lt;0.001) immune infiltration levels in UCEC. After correction of tumor purity, ACE2 in UCEC was significantly positively correlated with FCRL2 and MS4A1 in B cells, and FCGR3B, CEACAM3, SIGLEC5, CSF3R and S100A12 in neutrophils and CD84 in macrophages, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with CD68 and CD84 in macrophages. High ACE2 expression level has a favorable prognosis in the enriched B cells, CD4 + memory T cells, CD8 + T cells and macrophases subgroup in UCEC,and the enriched regulatory T cells and type 1 T helper cells subgroup in KIRP. Promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced, which explains to some extent the elevated ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP. Finally ,GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases were used to study the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro, the results showed that ACE2 expression levels in both of them were reduced after SARS-CoV infection.",2020-03-26,30.0,650.0,21.666666666666668,75.0,The Abnormal ACE2 Expression Correlated with Immune Infiltration May Worsen Progression After SARS-CoV-2 Infection in UCEC and KIRP,94.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3555195

" The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%.
