SARS-CoV-2 has great person-to-person transmission capability among close contacts. The secondary cases are more prone to have mild symptoms than index cases. There is no increased RR of secondary infection in blood relatives versus unrelated contacts. The high rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections highlights the urgent need to enhance active case finding strategy for early detection of infectious patients.,2020-03-18,163.0,1.0,"Clusters of Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in a Non-Epidemic Area, China",42.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551388

"1) The hospital reporting speed--the first case report to the local CDC, for H7N9(2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan city was 6 and 19 days, respectively. 2). The pathogen inspection speed-- the period from case reporting to technically confirming and re-checking pathogens, for COVID-19 was much quicker than that in H7N9(2013) in Shanghai (12days vs. 31days). 3). The government responding speed --from re-checking pathogens to the local governmentâ€™s emergency response, for H7N9 (2013) in Shanghai and COVID-19 in Wuhan was 4 and 15 days, respectively. 4) The total emergency disposal time of local government was 5 days longer in COVID-19 in Wuhan city than H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai (46 days vs. 41 days).InterpretationFrom H7N9 to COVID-19, the speed of detecting unknown pathogens greatly improved in China, whereas the hospital reporting of epidemics and decision-making by government of Hubei province was significantly slow, which might be an important influential factor of the outbreak of COVID-19.

"A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% of female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), coughing (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement or interstitial pneumonia evidenced by CT imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline IL-6 was significantly increased in severe type which is closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patient whose level of IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to the progression of pneumonia.

"The median age of the 101 patients was 51.0 years (IQR, 37.0-61.0) and 34 patients [33.6%] were medical staffs. On admission, the number of patients with uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia were 1 [1%], 86 [85%], 11[11%] and 2[2%], and another could not be unclassified because of pregnancy. 44 cases [51%] of the 86 mild pneumonia progressed to severe condition with 4 ( IQR, 1-7) days in median, and 9 patients [10%] further worsened to critical pneumonia within 4 (IQR, 3-8) days; 2 of the 11 severe patients improved to mild condition while 3 others deteriorated. Significant differences were observed among groups of different clinical stages in numbers of influenced pulmonary segments (6 (IQR, 2-12) vs 12 (IQR,6-15) vs 17 (IQR, 10-18), P &lt;0.001). A significantly upward trend was witnessed in ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows (33% vs 42% vs 55% vs 80%, P &lt;0.001) while pure ground-glass opacities gradually decreased with regard to radiologic patterns. While lymphocytes, prealbumin and albumin showed a downward trend as disease progressed from mild to severe or critical condition, an increasing trend was found in white blood cells, C-reactive protein, neutrophils and lactate dehydrogenase. And the proportions of serum amyloid A &gt; 300 mg/L in mild, severe and critical conditions were 18%, 46% and 71%, respectively.",2020-03-02,277.0,14.0,"Characteristics of Disease Progress in 101 Hospitalized Patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China",72.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3543620&utm_source=EC&utm_medium=Connect
"Ten different clusters were identified and ACE2 was mainly expressed in proximal tubule and glomerular parietal epithelial cells. From GO &amp; KEGG enrichment analysis, imbalance of ACE2 expression, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation, and neutrophil-related processes were the main issue of COVID-19 leading kidney injury.",2020-03-02,508.0,29.0,Single Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis of Human Kidney Reveals the Presence of ACE2 Receptor: A Potential Pathway of COVID-19 Infection,181.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3544810&utm_source=EC&utm_medium=Connect
