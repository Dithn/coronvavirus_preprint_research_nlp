,Probable Pangolin Origin of 2019-nCoV Associated with Outbreak of COVID-19,"In the late December of 2019, an epidemic pneumonia (announced recently as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)) outbreak in city of Wuhan in China and widely spreads all over the world. According to authoritative statistics, the COVID-19 has caused more than 40,000 laboratory-confirmed infections with more than 1000 deaths by 12 February 2020 and is still increasing. It was caused by a novel identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV (renamed this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2). Released complete genomes of 2019-nCoVs have helped rapid identification and diagnosis of the COVID-19. Currently, it is another key task to explore potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, which is vital to control COVID-19 spread. To this end, we re-investigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-like coronaviruses were detected by Liu et. By both deep assembly and multiple phylogenetic analyses, we found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, which would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.",,,,
,"ACP Risk Grade: A Simple Mortality Index for Patients with Confirmed or Suspected Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Disease (COVID-19) During the Early Stage of Outbreak in Wuhan, China","Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.",,,,
,"Clinical Characteristics of 24 Asymptomatic Infections with COVID-19 Screened Among Close Contacts in Nanjing, China","The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.",,,,
,"Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 124 Elderly Outpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The COVID-19 infection was a mass onset, with a strong concealment that is difficult to detect in the early stages, and early detection can reduce the harm of the disease. Due to traffic control and tight medical resources, the inability to treat in a timely manner will lead to worsening of the disease of elderly patients, and even fatal respiratory diseases.",,,,
,"Current Situation of the Corona Virus Disease Under Active Control and Prevention in China, Outside Hubei Province: A Real-World Epidemiological Analysis","The incubation period of COVID-19 is verified to be approximately 5-6 days. The first- and second-generation cases have been well controlled, and the daily number of third-generation cases is gradually decreasing. The epidemic reached a turning point in China except for Hubei on February 6. The control and prevention of cluster events may be the key to final victory.",,,,

,Phase- and Epidemic Regions- Adjusted Estimation of the Number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cases in China,"It is reasonable to speculate that the outbreak would be braked soon with the very strong prevention measures taken all over China. Current estimation provided evidence for planned work resumption under stringent prevention and control in regions outside Hubei Province in China to further support the fight against the epidemic. Nevertheless, strict prevention and control measures should still be maintained, especially in the regions with high intensity of epidemic such as Hunan, Guangzhou, Zhejiang Province as well as densely-populated cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, considering the possibility of the second outbreak brought by the work resumption and population migration, especially from Hubei Province and high-intensity cities outside Hubei Province.",,,,
,Characteristics of Pulmonary Auscultation in Patients   with 2019 Novel Coronavirus in China,"The present study describes common abnormalities in breath sounds and their distribution characteristics using electronic stethoscope, which to some extent provides insights into the pathophysiological and clinical process of the disease, suggesting that electronic auscultation can be readily applied at bedside in isolation wards to aid diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.",,,,

,The Spatiotemporal Estimation of the Dynamic Risk and the International Transmission of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak: A Global Perspective,"An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective.

We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country’s vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19.

Countries’ vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country’s vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries’ management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic.",,,,

,Candidate Targets for Immune Responses to 2019-Novel Coronavirus (nCoV): Sequence Homology- and Bioinformatic-Based Predictions,"Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses. However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.",,,,
,"Epidemic Characteristics of 2019-nCoV in China, Jan 23, 2020-Feb 11, 2020","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan city, Hunan Province, China in Dec 2019 and has rapidly spread to the other parts of China. It is important to know what has happened in this epidemic. We analyzed the epidemic curves of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 11, 2020. We found cumulative confirmed cases in this period increased in a fast speed in China. We also observed important disparities in cure ratio(%) and mortality across high-income and low-income areas. Finally, we observed important disparities in cure ratio (%) and mortality across seven regions. Effective prevention and control measures should be taken and the sustained transmission required full attention of public health.",,,,
,COVID-19 Epidemic: How Is the Depression of People Staying in Wuhan and People Leaving Wuhan? A Cross-Sectional Study,"We have identified a special mental health problem during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The incidence of depression among participants staying in or leaving Wuhan were significantly higher than those staying in other regions. Health and social care professionals should be alert to recognize the possible sequela of depression, should not only pay attention to the psychological burden of people staying in Wuhan, but also to those who left Wuhan. Community screening measures could reduce the risk of depression. During major outbreaks of infectious diseases, our findings might have implications for services that better protect the mental health of populations in China.",,,,

,"Statistical Estimate of Epidemic Trend, Suggestions and Lessons for Public Safety from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)","The rapid and intensive measures taken by the Chinese government brought Wuhan epidemic under preliminary control. Some factories have resumed work since February 11, 2020, which exist the potential to cause the epidemic to increase again nationwide. In particular, because of the Spring Festival, more than 100 million migrant workers have to rework and 200 million school students at all levels might open the spring semesters. Consequently, its impact on the coronavirus epidemic block should be stressed. The publicity and supervision department should strengthen these two special groups’ epidemic learning and education, monitor their itinerary through a big data platform, and control their health and travel status in real time. It is recommended that migrant workers should not resume their work earlier than Feb. 27, 2020 and the school semester should also postpone to Apr. 1, 2020 at the earliest since large population density of students and their concentrated living and learning place.",,,,
,Epidemic Trend and Transmission Risk of SARS-CoV-2 after Government Intervention in the Mainland of China: A Mathematical Model Study,"The series of quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23 were necessary and effective.

,Dynamics of the Latest 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Epidemic in China: A Descriptive Study,"The outbreak of COVID-19 is predominant in Hubei. The fatality is lower outside Hubei, a reflection of effective quarantine measures and medical care. The underestimated cases due to false-negative nucleic acid tests implies an actual lower fatality than the current estimation. The implication of broadened clinical diagnosis criteria in Hubei results in a sharp upswing in COVID-19 cases yet this could essentially counteract the underestimation of diagnosis and ensure prompt medical intervention to highly suspected cases. The interim gap in the knowledge of the actual dynamics of COVID-19 and heterogeneity of geographic differences need fulfilment by investigation on demographic characteristics and risk factors among population in various regions.",,,,

,The Role of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 in Coronaviruses/Influenza Viruses and Cardiovascular Disease,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has emerged as a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular (CV) disease and plays a pivotal role in coronaviruses and influenza viruses infections. The present review is primarily focused on the findings to indicate the role of ACE2 in the relationship between coronaviruses and influenza viruses with CV disease. It is postulated that the risk of coronavirus or influenza virus infection is high, at least partly, due to high ACE2 expression in population with high CV risk. Coronaviruses and influenza viruses vaccine usage in high CV risk population could be a potential strategy to prevent both CV disease and coronaviruses or influenza viruses infections.",,,,

,Rapid Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID19) by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,"Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes.

,Reverse Logistics Network Design for Effective Management of Medical Waste in Epidemic Outbreak: Insights from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan,"The outbreak of an epidemic disease may impose significant treats on human being and may further lead to a global crisis. In order to effectively control epidemic spread, a responsive logistics service is of vital importance. Over the years, researches have been focused on the establishment and the operations of temporary logistics network for delivering medical service and allocating emergency resources. However, the research focus has not been given to the design of a temporary reverse logistics network for medical waste treatment in epidemic outbreak, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk on both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper formulates a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreak, which aims at effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste and healthcare hazards within a very short period. The model is validated with a real-world case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even through the uncertainty of the future tendency of the COVID-19 spread is very high at the time of this research, some general managerial implications can still be obtained based on quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the computational results suggest installing and operating temporary incinerators at proper locations may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.",,,,
,The Psychological Impact of Quarantine and How to Reduce It: Rapid Review of the Evidence,"The January 2020 coronavirus outbreak has seen many countries plan to ‘self-isolate’ or quarantine people who have potentially come into contact with the infection. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on best available evidence. We conducted a rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. 3166 papers were found and 24 included in the review. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss and stigma. Some suggested long-lasting effects. Where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine for no longer than necessary; provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.

,"Understanding Unreported Cases in the 2019-Ncov Epidemic Outbreak in Wuhan, China, and the Importance of Major Public Health Interventions","We develop a mathematical model to provide epidemic predictions for the 2019-nCov epidemic in Wuhan, China. We use reported case data up to January 31, 2020 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission to parameterize the model. From the parameterized model we identify the number of unreported cases. We then use the model to project the epidemic forward with varying level of public health interventions. The model predictions emphasize the importance of major public health interventions in controlling 2019-nCov epidemics.",,,,
,Epidemic Prediction of 2019-nCoV in Hubei Province and Comparison with SARS in Guangdong Province,"Since the first case of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, the virus has spread very rapidly in China on December 31st, with Hubei Province having the most severe epidemic situation. As of 24:00 on February 2nd, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province has reached up to 11,177. In this paper, we select the epidemic situation in Hubei Province as the research object to establish the SEIQDR model of infectious diseases. The parameters are determined from the existing data to predict the trend of the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses, and the parameters are adjusted according to the prevention and control measures as well as possible changes. In comparison with Guangdong Province, where the SARS epidemic originated, it was concluded that the new coronavirus epidemic far exceeds the SARS epidemic in terms of infection rate and deaths. But thanks to the timely and effective prevention and control measures taken by the country, currently the epidemic is under control, and we predict the end of the epidemic is about 60 days earlier than the SARS virus. The total number of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei Province is 26,701 (ranges from 24,355 to 32,406), and the rapid growth period is expected to be from January 27th to February 10, and the epidemic will grow slowly after February 22nd.

,From SARS-CoV to Wuhan 2019-nCoV Outbreak: Similarity of Early Epidemic and Prediction of Future Trends,"The ongoing large-scale pneumonia outbreak in China is caused by the 2019-nCoV. As many aspects of the new virus are similar to SARS in 2003, knowledge and lessons of the SARS-CoV outbreak are valuable for responding to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, we assessed and compared the characteristics of those two outbreaks. Like the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV has a high human-to-human transmission capability and healthcare workers and family members are high risk populations. Using the reported case data so far, the cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. Regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent emergence and movement of a super-spreader. Nationwide surveillance and efficient measures are needed to control this epidemic.",,,,
,"Cell Pyroptosis, a Potential Pathogenic Mechanism of 2019-nCoV Infection","2019-nCoV is a novel coronavirus named in 2019. The number of people suffering from the virus kept increasing from China to the world. The initial infection characters of 2019-nCoV has been reported, including the symptoms and blood test results. Cell pyroptosis is a novel inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which has been largely studied recently. Here we noted that some of the 2019-nCoV results could be matched to the cell pyroptosis. This paper is aimed to discuss the relationship between 2019-nCoV infection and cell pyroptosis and put forward a potential hypothesis.",,,,
,Estimation of the Transmission Risk of 2019-nCov and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions,"It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCov infection, and how long should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since January 23rd 2020) with significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in 7 days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.",,,,
,"Early transmissibility assessment of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Between December 1, 2019 and January 26, 2020, nearly 3000 cases of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China have been reported. In this short analysis, we combine publicly available cumulative case data from the ongoing outbreak with phenomenological modeling methods to conduct an early transmissibility assessment. Our model suggests that the basic reproduction number associated with the outbreak (at time of writing) may range from 2.0 to 3.1. Though these estimates are preliminary and subject to change, they are consistent with previous findings regarding the transmissibility of the related SARS-Coronavirus and indicate the possibility of epidemic potential.",,,,
,"Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 99 Cases of 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia in Wuhan, China","The infection of the 2019-nCoV can result in severe and even fatal respiratory disease like ARDS. It is very important to actively prevent complications and secondary infections, treat underlying diseases, and provide timely organ function support. Early diagnosis, early isolation, multiple treatment, and intervention of CRRT and ECMO when necessary can effectively reduce mortality caused by severe coronavirus pneumonia.",,,,
,Clinical Characteristics and Vertical Transmission Potential of 2019-nCoV Infection in Patients with Pregnancy,"The clinical characteristics of NCIP in pregnancy were atypical. In our limited cases, no evidence of vertical transmission was found in NCIP patients with third trimester pregnancy.",,,,
,"Clinical Features and Computed Tomographic Manifestations of Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia: A Single Center Study in Shanghai, China","The imaging pattern of multifocal patchy peripheral pure ground glass opacity (GGO), mixed GGO or consolidation predominant in the lower lung, with more extensive GGO than consolidation in CT scans within the first week of illness is highly suspicious of 2019-nCoV infection during the outbreak, which may be crucial for early treatment and prompt isolation.",,,,
,Early in the Epidemic: Impact of Preprints on Global Discourse of 2019-nCOV Transmissibility,"As of February 11, 2020, more than 43,000 cases of a novel coronavirus (2019–nCoV) have been reported worldwide. Using publicly available data regarding the transmissibility potential (i.e. basic reproduction number) of 2019–nCoV, we demonstrate that relevant preprint studies generated considerable search and news media interest prior to the publication of peer-reviewed studies in the same topic area. We then show that preprint estimate ranges for the basic reproduction number associated with 2019–nCoV overlap with those presented by peer-reviewed studies that were published at a later date. Taken together, we argue that preprints are capable of driving global discourse during public health crises; however, we recommend that a consensus-based approach – as we have employed here – be considered as a means of assessing the robustness of preprint findings prior to peer review.",,,,
,"Nowcasting and Forecasting the Spreading of Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Its Association with Weather Variables in 30 Chinese Provinces: A Case Study,","On 1st of February, 2020, 2019-noV coronavirus outbreak was announced to the public and it was classified as epidemic. Although the disease was discovered in Hubei province, China, but it was exported to all other Chinese provinces and spread globally. The novel coronavirus disease couldn’t contained and it continued its spreading to all the world to exceed 34000 cases in main land China. Finding the environment effect on the epidemic spreading would help in understanding the growth of the disease. Besides, forecasting the size of infected, death, and recovered cases in China provinces would help to understand the domestic of this disease on global health.",,,,
,"The Evolution of Quarantined and Suspected Cases Determines the Final Trend of the 2019-nCoV Epidemics Based on Multi-Source Data Analyses,","Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. Further, uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.",,,,
,Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Outbreak; A Systematic Review for Published Papers,"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has been traced in China late 2019 and then was transmitted into more than 25 countries. A total of 49 papers have been published in 20 journals during the last January and current February. These papers tried to explain the source of virus, the transmission route, genomic map and the similarity to previous viruses as well as the pathogenesis, symptoms and treatment methods. The huge numbers of the articles which were published on 2019-nCoV make confusing for the readers, since many of the articles are addressed similar topics. In this paper a systematic analysis was conducted for the published articles. The finding of these papers were summarized. Moreover, the present paper aim to highlight the responses of scientists and Journals for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. This paper reviewed 49 peer viewed articles while hundreds article still in the preprint. It was appeared that the Lancet journal has the highest numbers of publications (29%) which given an early alarm for 2019-nCoV. The first paper suggested Baricitinib as potential treatment for 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease was published on 3 February in the Lancet Journal. In 16 January 2020, the genomic characteristics of the virus was published, followed by several papers on the diagnostic of the virus, pathogenicity and symptoms was more clear on 29 January. The Nature Journal was the fist which given an alarm for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In conclusion source of 2019-nCoV, treatment methods, as well as vaccines, pathogenicity of the virus in the patient with HIV or other virus infections, transmission to fetus in the pregnant women still need more investigation.",,,,
,Review of Health Security Capacities in Light of 2019-nCoV Outbreak – Opportunities for Strengthening IHR (2005) Implementation,"Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect and control outbreaks, which is underpinned by global variances in the strength of health systems to manage health emergencies. Half of all countries analysed in this study currently have in place operational readiness capacities which should enable an effective response to any potential health emergencies including 2019-nCoV. However, it is crucial to integrate/triangulate findings from local risk assessments to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to 2019-nCoV. Some countries may require external support if cases are identified and the infection spreads rapidly within their borders. As part of the commitment to the IHR (2005) countries should be implementing capacity building action to strengthen their ability to effectively prevent and manage health emergencies and the application of data analysis can support focused targeting of critical gaps that currently exist. Commitment to IHR (2005) also involves collaboration between States Parties to improve capacities for preventing and managing health emergencies which should also be carried out to improve preparedness. This will strengthen global readiness to contain existing outbreaks including the ongoing international spread of 2019-nCoV.",,,,
,Simulating the Infected Population and Spread Trend of 2019-nCov Under Different Policy by EIR Model,Given that 2019-nCoV could be controlled under the strong prevention measures of what China has taken and it will take about three months. The confirmed infected individuals will still keep quick increasing for 14 days (approximately equal to the sum of exposed period and infection period) after the start time point of control. The strong prevention measures should be insisted until the epidemic Coronavirus. Other domestic places and overseas have confirmed infected individuals should take strong interventions immediately. Earlier strong prevention measures could efficiently stop the independent self-sustaining outbreaks in other cities globally.,,,,
,Correlation Analysis of the Population Emigration Rate in Wuhan and the Trend of Novel Pneumonia in Hubei Province,"China is still facing a huge challenge of novel coronavirus. However, despite the increasing number of confirmed cases, the current cure rate has exceeded the case fatality rate. There is a positive correlation between the emigration rate of Wuhan population and the number of confirmed cases and the mortality rate in Hubei Province, so we still need to strictly control the outward circulation of Wuhan population.",,,,
